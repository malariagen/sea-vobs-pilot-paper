MetaPlot is a set of Metapost macros for manipulating pre-generated
plots (and similar objects), and formatting them for inclusion in
a Metapost figure.  The intent is that the plots can be generated
by some outside program, in an abstract manner that does not require
making decisions about on-page sizing and layout, and then they can
be imported into MetaPlot and arranged using the full capabilities
of Metapost.  Metaplot also includes a very flexible set of macros
for generating plot axes, which may be useful in other contexts as
well.

Presently, MetaPlot is in something of a pre-release beta state; it
is quite functional, but the syntax of the commands are still 
potentially in flux.  Bug reports and other suggestions would be
most welcome!

The documentation currently consists of a preprint of a paper on
MetaPlot given at Practical TeX 2004, as metaplot_preprint.pdf.

A set of examples of MetaPlot usage are also given in the /examples
directory; these currently consist of the figures for the afore-
mentioned paper, along with the various C++ programs and support 
files needed to produce them.
