The feynmp-auto takes care of running METAPOST on the
output files produced by the feynmp package so the
compiled pictures will be available in the next run
of LaTeX.

Usage: simply change the call

  \usepackage{feynmp}

to

  \usepackage{feynmp-auto}

Options to feynmp are honored also by the feynmp-auto
package.

This is version 1.1 of the package

o Changes from version 1.0:

  The `force' option has been added; it overrides the
  MD-5 checks for avoiding useless METAPOST runs.
