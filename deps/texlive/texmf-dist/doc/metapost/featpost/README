Welcome to FeatPost-0.8.8! 
  The file "MPexamples.html" contains the complete collection of examples
  as raster PNG images and links to the source code of each one.
  That same collection of examples is also in "doc" directory in the file
  "doc/Exemplifier.pdf" as exact postscript diagrams but without links. 
  The user manual is also in the "doc" directory: "doc/featpostmanual.pdf".
  There a smaller presentation version: "doc/featpostbeamer.pdf".
  A wide-range tutorial can be found in "doc/metapostpropaganda.pdf".
  The "doc/metapostpropagandafiles" directory contains additional examples.

Please,
  the first time you make a diagram with FeatPost-0.8.8, send me an e-mail 
  message with the subject "FeatPost". My address is lng@fct.unl.pt
