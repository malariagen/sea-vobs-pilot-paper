The MetaPost package latexMP implements a user-friendly
interface to access LaTeX-based typesetting capabilities in
MetaPost.
The text to be typeset is given as string. This allows even
dynamic text elements, for example counters, to be used in
labels. 

All files of the package belong to the Public Domain.

Since version 1.2 the MP prologues value is not set by
latexMP anymore. Additionally, the compatibility with
the normal btex..etex behaviour has been improved.
