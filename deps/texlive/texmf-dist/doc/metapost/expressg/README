    The expressg MetaPost package provides facilities to assist in
drawing diagrams that consist of boxes, lines, and annotations,
such as IDEF or UML. Particular support is provided for creating 
EXPRESS-G diagrams.

    To install the package:
o run: latex expressg.ins (which will generate expressg.mp,
                           expeg.mp, expeg.tex, n2mps.sh and n2mpsprl.prl)
o run: latex expressg.dtx
       (Note: if you don't have the docmfp package, read the instructions
              at the start of this file)
o If you want an index then run: makeindex -s gind.ist expressg
o run: latex expressg.dtx
o Print expressg.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual 
o Move expressg.mp to a location where MetaPost will find it.
o To use the scripts make them executable (and they may require editing
  to run on your system).

    The file expeg.ps contains some example diagrams. To generate your
own copy, and to test your installation:
o Move expeg.mp and expeg.tex to a working directory
o Run MetaPost on expeg.mp (probably either as: mp expeg  or as: mpost expeg)
o Run LaTeX on expeg.tex
o print the result via dvips or other dvi processor that supports PostScript
  graphics.

    The file aam.mp contains some more example MetaPost code. The
resulting diagrams are in aamfigs.pdf which has been generated by pdfLaTeX
from aamfigs.tex.
