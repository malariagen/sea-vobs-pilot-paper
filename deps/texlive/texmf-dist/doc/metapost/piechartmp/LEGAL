WARRANTY
========

There is no warranty for piechartMP, to the extent permitted by
applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the
Copyright holder provides piechartMP `as is' without warranty of any
kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
program is with you. Should piechartMP prove defective, you assume
the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
will the Copyright holder, or any of the individual authors named in
the source for piechartMP, be liable to you for damages, including
any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out
of any use of piechartMP or out of inability to use piechartMP
(including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered
inaccurate or losses sustained by you or by third parties as a result
of a failure of The Program to operate with any other programs), even
if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of
such damages.


DISTRIBUTION
============

Redistribution of unchanged files is allowed provided that all files
that make up the distribution of piechartMP are distributed.
In particular this means that piechartMP has to be distributed
including the files in the piechartMP-README.
If you distribute piechartMP together with a installation programm
or installation programms, you have to take care, that users cannot
skip or delete parts of piechartMP without be well informed about
this action.

The distribution of piechartMP contain a listing of all the files
covered by this license at README.

If you receive only some of these files from someone, complain!

The distribution of changed versions of certain files included in the
piechartMP, and the reuse of code from piechartMP, are allowed
under the following restrictions:

 * It is allowed only if the legal notice in the file does not
   expressly forbid it.
   See note below, under "Conditions on individual files".
 
 * You rename the file before you make any changes to it, unless the
   file explicitly says that renaming is not required.  Any such changed
   files must be distributed under a license that forbids distribution
   of those files, and any files derived from them, under the names used
   by the original files in the distribution of piechartMP.

 * You change any `identification string' in piechartMP to clearly 
   indicate that the file is not part of the standard system.

 * You change the `error report address' in any modified versions of
   piechartMP, so that reports for files not maintained by the
   original program maintainers are directed to the maintainers of the
   changed files. 

 * You acknowledge the source and authorship of the original version
   in the modified file.

 * You also distribute the unmodified version of the file.
 
 * You distribute an appropriate documentation.

The above restrictions are not intended to prohibit, and hence do
not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it
becomes identical to the latest version of that file in piechartMP.

========================================================================


Conditions on individual files
==============================

The individual files may bear additional conditions which supersede
the general conditions on distribution and modification contained in
this file.

Typical examples of files with more restrictive modification
conditions would be files that contain the text of copyright notices.

 * The conditions on individual files differ only in the
   extent of *modification* that is allowed.

 * The conditions on *distribution* are the same for all the files.
   Thus a (re)distributor of a complete, unchanged copy of The Program
   need meet only the conditions in this file; it is not necessary to
   check the header of every file in the distribution to check that a
   distribution meets these requirements.

Such files are:

 * LEGAL, README: You are not allowed to modify these files.
