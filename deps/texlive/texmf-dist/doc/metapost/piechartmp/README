This is the README of the piechartMP MetaPost package.
For license informations see LEGAL.

The package consists of the files:
- README                  (this file)
- LEGAL                   (license information)
- piechartmp.mp           (the MetaPost module)
- piechartmp.pdf          (english documentation)


This is a BETA-release, but I believe that
the user interface will not change anymore.
Please send bug-reports and suggestions to:
Jens-Uwe Morawski <morawski@gmx.net>
