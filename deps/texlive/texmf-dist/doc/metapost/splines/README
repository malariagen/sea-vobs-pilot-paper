Splines -- version 0.2a

This package consists of a few macros useful for producing cubic splines
in MetaPost (or Metafont).

Given a sequence of N+1 points, a spline is a path $z = f(t)$, $0 \le t
\le N$, connecting them, which is a cubic function of $t$ between
points, and has continuous first and second derivatives.

Such a spline is two dimensional and can wander about anywhere in the
picture plane. Another type of spline is one dimensional: given a
sequence of $N$ locations $x_0 < x_1 < \dots < x_N$ on the $x$-axis and
corresponding values $y_j$, a cubic spline interpolant is a function $y
= f(x)$ satisfying $f(x_j) = y_j$, which is cubic between the $x_j$ and
which has continuous first and second derivatives.

With these macros one can draw two-dimensional cubic splines and the
graphs of cubic spline interpolants.

The files of this package consist of:
    splines.dtx         The documented source code.
    splines.ins         LaTeX this to produce the file splines.mp.
    splines.pdf         The documentation.
    testsplines.mp      Uses the macros to produce a few splines.
