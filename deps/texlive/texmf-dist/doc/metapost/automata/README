AUTOMATA.MP - version 0.3

This package is a collection of macros for METAPOST to
make easier to draw finite-state machines, automata, 
labeled graphs, etc. Nodes can be either isolated or 
arranged into matrices or trees; edges connect pairs 
of nodes through arbitrary paths. Some parameters can
be specified to define different shapes for nodes and/or 
different styles for the edges.

The archive consists of the following files:

- README   This file

- automata.mp   This file defines the macros. It should 
  be included in a main .mp file by using the directive 
     input automata;

- example.mp    This is a short example of an .mp file
  that produces a finite-state automaton 
  (it should be compiled with metapost using
      mp -tex=latex example.mp
   and it should produce a PS file named example.0)

- example.0     This is the PS file generated from
  example.mp

- example.tex   This shows how to include MetaPost
  figures in a LaTeX document

- example.pdf   This is the PDF file generated from 
  example.tex
