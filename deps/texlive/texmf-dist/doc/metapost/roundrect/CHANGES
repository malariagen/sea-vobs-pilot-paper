v2.2, released on 19 February 2016:  added the ability to
include arbitrary packages (or indeed, arbitrary TeX
definitions) for typesetting labels, with the string
rrusepackage.

v2.1, released on 7 August 2015:  incremental improvements.
Added in dropshadows and parameters for controlling them.
Updated and rearranged the documentation.

v2.0, released on 1 August 2015:  complete rewrite.  The
code is much cleaner and works better and more consistently.
Removed all the "titlebar" options; it's better to form such
things out of an entirely separate rectangle.  Much more
granular control over appearance.  Also several
"convenience" macros to allow adjusting multiple, related
settings at one time.

v1.0, released on 29 July 2015:  initial release.  All basic
functionality implemented.
