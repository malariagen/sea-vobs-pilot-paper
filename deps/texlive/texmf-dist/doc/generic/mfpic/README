MFpic defines a command group \mfpic...\endmfpic (optionally in LaTeX
an environment, mfpic) and drawing commands to be used inside this group.
When TeX (or LaTeX) is run on a file containing those commands, a
MetaPost (or Metafont) source file is created. When that file is correctly
processed by MetaPost (or Metafont), and LaTeX or TeX is run again, the
result is a figure in the TeX document at the location of each
environment.

See install.txt for installation instructions. See mfpguide.pdf for a
short tutorial. See below for a summary of features added since the
previous major release (1.0). See the manual mfpic-doc.pdf for more
detailed instructions and descriptions of features.

This is mfpic version 1.10

DISCLAIMER

While every effort has been made to make mfpic useful, it comes with no
warranty, expressed or implied.

MANIFEST
--------
Here is a list, plus explanation of purpose, of all files in the mfpic
distribution. Read it *before* trying to process any of the example
files. These files constitute the mfpic distribution to which the LPPL
applies.

The six files marked with "+" below are the only ones essential to using
all the facilities of mfpic. The three files marked with "*" below are
sufficient to generate those essential files.

All the *.tex files in the doc directory (except the plain TeX file
mfpcard.tex) require the LaTeX style file mfpdoc.sty. The mfpic manual
is mfpic-doc.pdf. A tutorial is available in mfpguide.pdf.

The directory names given below are subdirectories of graphics/mfpic/ in
your nearest CTAN mirror (go to http://mirror.ctan.org/)

Source files (in source/):
------------
*mfpic.dtx      Contains mfpic.sty and mfpic.tex
*grafbase.dtx   Contains grafbase.mf, grafbase.mp and dvipsnam.mp
*mfpic.ins      The unpacking script: run tex or latex on it. It reads
                in mfpic.dtx and grafbase.dtx and produces the six
                required run-time files (marked "+" below)

TeX/LaTeX code (in tex/):
--------------
+mfpic.tex      Basic TeX/LaTeX code
+mfpic.sty      LaTeX2e wrapper for mfpic.tex
+mfpicdef.tex   Input file used by metapost for TeX labels

MetaPost/Metafont code (in metapost/ and metafont/):
----------------------
+grafbase.mp    MetaPost macros supporting mfpic
+dvipsnam.mp    Color definitions for MetaPost, needed by grafbase.mp
+grafbase.mf    Metafont macos supporting mfpic
