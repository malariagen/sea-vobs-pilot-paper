This is version 1.10 of mfpic. See README for a list of files and a
brief description of each.

Generating and installing the files
-----------------------------------

This sections is unnecessary if you get
    http://mirror.ctan.org/install/graphics/mfpic.tds.zip
when it becomes available. Just unzip it in a texmf directory.
Alternatively, you can get the entire graphics/mfpic/ directory from
http://mirror.ctan.org/ and move those files as described below

-- If you have acquired only mfpic.ins, mfpic.dtx and grafbase.dtx, put
   the three in the same temporary  directory and change to that
   directory. Run latex (or tex) on mfpic.ins, which should produce
   these six files:
      mfpic.tex         grafbase.mf
      mfpic.sty         grafbase.mp
      mfpicdef.tex      dvipsnam.mp

-- If you have an older version of mfpic, remove any old files with the
   same names as the above from your TeX directories, or ensure that the
   following procedure overwrites them (back them up first, if you wish).

-- Copy mfpic.tex and mfpicdef.tex where TeX and LaTeX will find them,
   and mfpic.sty where LaTeX will find it. On any TDS compliant system
   (such as TeXLive, MacTeX and MiKTeX) they can all be put in
   $TEXMF/tex/generic/mfpic/ (where $TEXMF indicates a directory serving
   as a root of a texmf tree).

-- Copy grafbase.mp and dvipsnam.mp where MetaPost will find them, for
   example $TEXMF/metapost/mfpic/ .

-- Copy grafbase.mf where Metafont will find it. For example,
   $TEXMF/metafont/mfpic/ .

-- Copy mfpguide.pdf, mfpic-doc.pdf. mfpcard.pdf where documentation is
   kept. For example, $TEXMF/doc/generic/mfpic/ . Optionally, copy the
   *.tex versions of these, plus mfpdoc.sty, lcheadings.ist  and
   coil.mps, as well as examples/*.* either to the documentation area or
   to the same place as mfpic.tex. Also optional: copy the two .dtx
   files and mfpic.ins to the source area
   ($TEXMF/source/generic/mfpic/).

-- If required by your TeX system (most do): update the tex filename
   database.

There is one optional step that may be useful if you plan to make use of
mfpic's support for Metafont (you may skip this if you only wish to use
its MetaPost support): find the file modes.mf on your system. Typically
this will be in $TEXMF/metafont/misc/ . Find, near the end of that file,
a line similar to

    localfont := ljfour;

Replace, if necessary, the string "ljfour" by one of the modes defined
in that file. At minimum, select one whose resolution (DPI) matches both
your printer and the configuration of your dvi viewer. If you make such
a change, regenerate the mf.base file (fmtutil on MacTeX or TeXLive;
MiKTeX Options in MiKTeX). On some systems this may be named plain.base.

Read mfpguide.pdf before trying anything further. If you are already
familiar with mfpic (version 0.2.10.9 or later) you can probably get
going right away.

If you want to read the documented source code for mfpic, run pdflatex
on mfpic.dtx and grafbase.dtx three times each. Then run makeindex for
each:
    makeindex -s gind.ist -o mfpic.ind mfpic.idx
    makeindex -s gind.ist -o grafbase.ind grafbase.idx
and then pdflatex again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you desire to remake mfpic-doc.pdf, make sure mfpic-doc.tex and
mfpdoc.sty are in the current directory or where LaTeX can find them.
Make sure that coil.mps is also where LaTeX can find it. Edit, if you
like, the paper size option in the \documentclass command in
mfpic-doc.tex. (The document uses Times for the main font family,
LuxiMono for a typewriter font, and CMSS for a sans serif font. Packages
mathptmx amd luximono are required.) Then run
    pdflatex mfpic-doc
three times. Make sure lcheadings.ist is where makeindex can find it
and run
    makeindex -s lcheadings.ist -o mfpic-doc.ind mfpic-doc.idx
Then
    pdflatex mfpic-doc
at least 2 more times.

You could do something similar for mfpguide.tex:
    pdflatex mfpguide
    mpost guide.mp
    pdflatex mfpguide
    pdflatex mfpguide
This relies on the mfpic package itself.
