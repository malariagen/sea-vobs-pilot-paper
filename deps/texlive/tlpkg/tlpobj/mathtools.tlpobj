shortdesc Mathematical tools to use with amsmath
longdesc Mathtools provides a series of packages designed to enhance the
longdesc appearance of documents containing a lot of mathematics. The
longdesc main backbone is amsmath, so those unfamiliar with this
longdesc required part of the LaTeX system will probably not find the
longdesc packages very useful. Mathtools provides many useful tools for
longdesc mathematical typesetting. It is based on amsmath and fixes
longdesc various deficiencies of amsmath and standard LaTeX. It
longdesc provides: Extensible symbols, such as brackets, arrows,
longdesc harpoons, etc.; Various symbols such as \coloneqq (:=); Easy
longdesc creation of new tag forms; Showing equation numbers only for
longdesc referenced equations; Extensible arrows, harpoons and
longdesc hookarrows; Starred versions of the amsmath matrix environments
longdesc for specifying the column alignment; More building blocks:
longdesc multlined, cases-like environments, new gathered environments;
longdesc Maths versions of \makebox, \llap, \rlap etc.; Cramped math
longdesc styles; and more... Mathtools requires mhsetup.
