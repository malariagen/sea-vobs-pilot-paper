# CircleCI seems to have some weird issue with harfbuzz tarballs. The files
# come out with modification times such that the build scripts want to rerun
# automake, etc.; we need to run it ourselves since we don't have the precise
# version that the build scripts embed. And the 'configure' script comes out
# without its execute bit set. In a Docker container running locally, these
# problems don't occur.
