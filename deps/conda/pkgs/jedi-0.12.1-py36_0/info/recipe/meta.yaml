about:
    description: 'Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that can be used in IDEs/editors.

        Its historic focus is autocompletion, but does static analysis for now as

        well. Jedi is fast and is very well tested. It understands Python on a

        deeper level than all other static analysis frameworks for Python.
